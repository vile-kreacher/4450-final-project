# 4450 final project

This project is a simple parser for Python language that implements most of the key features of the language. I worked alone on this project.
Team members: Anna Kochman (vile-kreacher)

Setup required:
Install Python3
Install antlr4 for Python: use pip and guides available through antlr documentation
The most current version of Python and antlr4 are preferred

How to use/run:
In the directory where the grammar, parser, lexer, etc. are located, use antlr4-parse Arithmetic.g4 program -gui to see a visual representation of the parse tree for your input. I was not able to implement support for Python-esque indentation and dedentation for blocks. Python driver code could also be written to test the functionality of the input, but the given grammar will parse the input.

I have attached some video files with my final submission that show the parse trees for comments and for an if statement being produced.
